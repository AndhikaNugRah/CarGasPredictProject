CO2 Emissions Prediction Model

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the CO2 emissions of a vehicle based on its weight and volume using linear regression. 
The project also includes a simple user interface that allows users to input their vehicle's specifications and receive an estimate of its CO2 emissions.

Overview:
This project uses Python with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to develop a predictive model for estimating CO2 emissions based on the weight and volume of a vehicle. 
The model is trained using a dataset provided in a CSV file called 'data_car.csv' and then used to make predictions for new input values.

Key Features:
Linear regression model trained on a dataset of vehicle specifications and corresponding CO2 emissions
Users can input their vehicle's weight and volume to receive an estimate of its CO2 emissions
Simple text-based user interface with recursive calls to allow users to continue making predictions

Technical Requirements:
Python programming language
NumPy library for numerical computations
Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks, including linear regression
CSV file 'data_car.csv' containing the training dataset

Design:
The project's design is focused on developing a simple yet effective predictive model using linear regression. 
The user interface is text-based and allows users to input their vehicle's specifications and receive an estimate of its CO2 emissions.
